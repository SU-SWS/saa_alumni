Netlify hosted, Gatsby built, storyblok headless cms site for alumni.stanford.edu


Installation
---

*Development*
```
cp example.env .env.development
* Get the Storyblok preview access token *
* Get the FontAwesome NPM token from the Netlify site settings in environment variables *
* Manually add the access tokens to .env.development *
nvm use
FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=MYFATOKEN npm install
gatsby develop
```

*Production*
```
cp example.env .env.production
* Get the Storyblok public access token *
* Get the FontAwesome NPM token from the Netlify site settings in environment variables *
* Manually add the access tokens to .env.production and remove the `GATSBY_HOT_LOADER=fast-refresh line`*
nvm use
FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN=MYFATOKEN npm install
gatsby build
```

Using the Storyblok Editor on localhost
---

Currently Storyblok v2 doesn't allow accessing the environment with http, so to make it work, https has to be added to localhost. For your convenience we have created the certificate and key but your system may not trust this self signed cert. Once you have localhost up and running you can visit the url in the browser and proceed past the warning or you can add the certificate to your trusted list.

OSX:
https://readwriteexercise.com/posts/trust-self-signed-certificates-macos/

To start:
```
npm run dev
npm run https-proxy-start
```

Or to choose your own ports:
```
netlify dev
npm run hps -- --target=3010 --source=64946
```

Connecting to Storyblok
---

You will need an access token to connect to a storyblok space. Contact a member on the project team to get one. Once you have obtained a key you will need to add it to your local environment file. In `.env.development` and/or `.env.production` add the value of the access key to the `GATSBY_STORYBLOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` variable. `Development` builds can use the `preview` access tokens from Storyblok, but `Production` builds should only ever use the `public` access tokens. This is to ensure no unpublished content is accidentally revealed to the public.

Development vs Production builds.
---

This project makes use of the NODE_ENV environment variable to run different builds. We also use `.env.*` files to pass through configuration options.

### Netlify

Once your site is integrated with Netlify you can add contextual build variables for your site in the Netlify deploy settings.
We're currently using [netlify-plugin-contextual-env](https://github.com/cball/netlify-plugin-contextual-env) which means if you
want contextual env values for a variable named `GATSBY_STORYBLOK_TOKEN` in your builds you would define the following in Netlify:
- `GATSBY_STORYBLOK_TOKEN` = `THIS IS THE BASE VALUE THAT WILL BE USED IF NOT OVERRIDDEN WITH CONTEXT`
- `PRODUCTION_GATSBY_STORYBLOK_TOKEN` = `THIS VALUE WOULD BE USED IN PRODUCTION`
- `DEV_GATSBY_STORYBLOK_TOKEN` = `THIS VALUE WOULD BE USED FOR OUR DEV BRANCH DEPLOY`
- `DEPLOY_PREVIEW_GATSBY_STORYBLOK_TOKEN` = `THIS VALUE WOULD BE USED FOR OUR DEPLOY PREVIEWS FOR DEV AND PROD`

Make sure to add netlify deploy-preview to your github `dev` branch require status checks to ensure proper PR gating.

### Codeclimate

To add codeclimate checks log in to codeclimate and add your repository with `dev` as the default branch.
Go the codeclimate repo settings and install the Github pull request status updates. Now go back to Github
and make sure `codeclimate` is added to required Status Checks for the `dev` branch protection settings.

## Development Workflows

All general development work should be based off of the `dev` branch.
Branches should abide by the following branch name format: `{branch-type}/JIRA-###_optional-description-of-task`
where `branch-type` is `feature/`, `task/`, or `bug/` and `JIRA-###` corresponds with the Jira ticket number.
This will ensure that features get labeled and organized correctly in the release and connect to Jira appropriately.

- Create branch from `dev` following the above outlined branch naming conventions.
- Complete work in your branch.
- Create a pull request from your branch into `dev` branch. This will deploy a Netlify preview for your branch.
- On PR approval, **squash merge** your branch with the following merge commit message format: `JIRA-### | Brief description of work completed`.

Pull requests against dev will need to pass status checks for the following:
- lint
- test
- codeclimate
- Branch up to date with `dev`
- Netlify build/deploy preview

Pull requests merged into dev will kickoff a Netlify branch deploy for the `dev` branch.

## Release Workflow

To release code to production you will need to create a release branch from `dev` and make a pull request to `main`.
Including semver tags (`[major]`, `[minor]`, `[patch]`) will automatically add a semver label to the PR which will
determine how to increment semver during release. If no label is provided it will default to `patch`.

- Create branch from `dev` (or commit ref from `dev`) with `release/` prefix and optional semver tag (e.g. `release/completely-refactor-everything[major]`)
- Create a pull request from your `release/my-cool-release` branch into `main`
- On PR approval, do a standard **merge commit** into `main`

Merges to `main` will kickoff the following tasks:
- Semver version bump
- Publish github release
- Netlify production build and deploy
- Merge changes back into `dev`


## Hotfix Workflow

Hotfix workflows should only ever be used when there is a production bug that needs immediate attention and
there are changes in `dev` that are not ready for deployment.

- Create a `hotfix/` branch from `main`
- Complete the fix in your branch
- Create a pull request from your hotfix branch into `main`
- On PR approval, **squash merge** your branch with the following merge commit message format: `JIRA-### | Brief description of hotfix`.

Depending on the nature your hotfix and the history of `dev` you may need to to manually merge `main` back into `dev` to resolve merge conflicts.
